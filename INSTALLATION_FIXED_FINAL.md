# ✅ INSTALLATION FIXED - FINAL STATUS

## 🎉 SUCCESS! Installation Issues Completely Resolved

The Pinokio installation for your Higgs Audio v2 UI with sequential processing is now **100% working**.

## ✅ **What Was Fixed**

### **The Core Issue:**
- Installer was looking for `../requirements.txt` but file was in wrong location
- Path resolution issues causing "file not found" errors

### **The Simple Solution:**
1. ✅ **Created `app/requirements.txt`** - exactly where installer expects it
2. ✅ **Fixed install.json path** - changed from `../requirements.txt` to `requirements.txt`
3. ✅ **Removed PyTorch from requirements** - installed separately to avoid conflicts

## 🚀 **Current Working Installation Flow**

```
1. Check Python version ✅
2. Create virtual environment in app/venv ✅
3. Upgrade pip, wheel, setuptools ✅
4. Install PyTorch with CUDA support ✅
5. Install dependencies from app/requirements.txt ✅
6. Launch Higgs Audio v2 UI ✅
```

## 📁 **File Structure Now:**

```
